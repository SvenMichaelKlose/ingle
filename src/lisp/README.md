AttoLisp
========

This is the beginning of library "lispheap" to read, access
and print data in Lisp format to simplify C code having to
deal with documents, configurations and the like.

The GUI could for example read documents and traverse them
to create widgets â€“ very much as a replacement for HTML.

# Current status

Garbage chars outputted where newlines should be happening.
