It just appeared to me that having a
separate kernal stack might be too much
of a big deal to not implements,
although I'm not sure why yet.  The
kernel is currently more of a regular
library with a strange interface to
applications but banking.  I really
don't see no problems at the moment.

Looks like some basic data structures
are going rogue.  Did a two day break
to start (s)porting the Small-C compiler
to Commodore 8-bitters.  That's extreme
fun.  Also found a book about systems
programming which I didn't even know I
own.  Bliss...  Oh, shit!  I'm a nerd.
