How To Build Small-C v3.2
=========================

# Prerequisites

You need a Unix-like system with a
working C compiler environment and GNU
Make.

On Debian-based systems install a C
programming environment like so:

~~~sh
sudo apt install build-essentials
~~~

# Build From Source

Step into direcory 'src' and run the
make script;

~~~sh
cd src
make all
~~~

There should now be an executable called
'scc6502' which will explain itself if
invoked without arguments.

Happy coding!
