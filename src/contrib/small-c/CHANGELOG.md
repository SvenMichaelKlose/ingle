Small-C Change Log (v3.2)
=========================

# Byte code as Intermediate Representation

The generated byte code can be converted
to lines of text and be processed by
assembly macros to target specific CPUs.

# Accepts short form of 'unsigned int'

For 'unsigned int' declarations the
'int' keyword can be omitted:

~~~C
unsigned int i;
unsigned i2;    // Same.
~~~
