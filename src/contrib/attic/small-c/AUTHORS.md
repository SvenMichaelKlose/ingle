# Previous Authors

This version is based on Chris Lewis'
revival of Ron Cain's original Small-C
compiler.  He introduced several
upgrades and new features while
maintaining the simplicity and fun of
tinkering that the earlier versions
promoted.

P.L. Woods added ANSI-style argument
type declarations.

More cleaning up was done by
https://github.com/ncb85/SmallC-857
which was used as the basis for what
you have here.
